#  📊 Interactive Matrix Application

Welcome to the Interactive Matrix Application, a React project built using TypeScript and React Context. This application features a dynamic matrix that allows users to interact with cell values, highlight nearest cells, view row percentages, and manage rows efficiently. The project demonstrates modern front-end techniques while ensuring state management, type safety, and a responsive design.

## 🛠️ Used Methods and Tools
### ⛳️ TypeScript & React Context

The application is built with TypeScript for enhanced type safety and React Context for state management, avoiding the use of Redux and CSS-in-JS. This setup ensures a clean, maintainable codebase and a robust architecture.

### 📊 Dynamic Matrix Interactions

Increase Cell Values: Users can click on any cell to increase its value by 1. The sums and averages are recalculated in real-time.
Highlight Nearest Values: Hovering over a cell will highlight the nearest X cells based on their values, enhancing user interaction.
Percentage Heatmaps: Hovering over the sum cell in a row will display each cell's percentage of the row's total, with a heatmap background representing these percentages.

### 🚀 Responsive Design

The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring it adapts seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops. This enhances accessibility and usability for a diverse audience.

### 🔥 Deployment
The production build is deployed to GitHub Pages, providing easy access to the application from any device with an internet connection.
